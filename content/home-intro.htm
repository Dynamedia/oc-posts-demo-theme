<p>
    Welcome to the Posts playground.
</p>

<p>
    You can log in <a href="/backend">here</a> with any of the 
    following details.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>editor / editor</li>
    <li>writer / writer</li>
    <li>guest / guest</li>
</ul>

<p>Only editors can publish posts. Writers have more
   permissions enabled than guests - They are very restricted</p>
 
<p>This website will be reset to its default state on the hour. 
Some content is protected to maintain the integrity of the demo, but
feel free to create, publish and delete anything you like.</p>

<p>The German translation of the theme and posts is for demo purposes 
and may not be accurate.</p>

<p>Not all posts are translated so expect 404
errors by design. Untranslated Category and Tag pages will always be available, however.</p>
 
<p>You can find out more about Posts for October
